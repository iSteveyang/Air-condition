# Air-condition
The project designed an indoor environment monitoring system based on the experimental platform, which can automatically collect the data in the room in real time, and process the analysis data to transfer to the interface we need. 
And after some environmental values reach the warning value, the sound warning is given, and the fan is automatically turned on for emergency treatment. 
It's UI is based on QT with c++.The main code is about ARM-LINUX.
Base on UP-TECH S2410/P270 DVP Embedded experimental platform. With PC operating system && Fedora 14 HyperTerminal (or X-shell) ARM-LINUX development environment.
